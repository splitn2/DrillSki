Define a binding drilling pattern
  *Shall we stick to mm since thats what most ski boots and bindings (probably all actually) are measured in
  *The ski is oriented standing vertically on its tail longways in the Y axis
  *Points in x are relative - or + to the end to end centre line of the ski
  *Points in y are relative - or + to the ski boot sole centre line so we can start making a relativity to boot sole length BSL.
  Points in z are hole depth , Z zero is the top sheet, -z is the depth eg. -z9.0 is a 9mm deep hole below topsheet level
  *toe piece co-ordinates defined clockwise starting from front left screw eg. T1_x,y T2_x,y T3_x,y T4_x,y .......
  *centrescrew (eg Marker Duke) can be another toe reference
  *heel piece co-ordinates defined clockwise starting from front left screw eg. H1_x,y H2_x,y H3_x,y H4_x,y .......
   *screw diameter(s) defined by SD
  *screw length(s) defined by SL
  *From a zero point , negative values are to the left, positive values are to the right, logically.....

Using the templates that exist from Knut Pohl, they reference x and y values for drilling holes whose origin can be traced back to the BSL zero line and ski centerline.
So this should make it easy to do in a spreadsheet for a start to generate co-ordinates for X and Y to be then converted to gcode.
However the best way is to take that BSL and binding xy drilling data and build a simple app that generates the gcode / pdf / dxf directly
